        <h2> Why I am in AltSchool</h2>
        <p>I am in AltSchool Africa because i believe they have the structure and the means to impact and make anyone a worldclass engineer, i have seen their success stories been told by people on twitter and that is one of the reason i decided to enroll with them</p>

        <h2>What Do I Intend to Achieve at AltSchool Africa</h2>
        <p>I joined <a href="https://altschoolafrica.com/">AltSchool Africa</a>  to become a software engineer that can compete on a global scale, my student id is <B>ALT/SOE/023/2141</B> .Before joining Altschool Africa i have been self-learning but it seems there was no direction. Also, due to the financial challenges that i am facing, i believe a skill in tech can also serve as another stream of income for, so i believe AltSchool Africa with her structure can give me bearing in this journey and would ultimately give me that dream of financial freedom once i start earning in tech.</p>
